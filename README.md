Description
-----------

Valtech Poker helps you with requirement estimation when real planning poker cards aren't handy.

Planning poker is a fun and quick way to drive estimation. It's very popular in agile methodologies like Scrum or XP but in no way limited to these.

In planning poker, members of the group make estimates by playing numbered cards face-down to the table, instead of speaking them aloud. The cards are revealed and the estimates are then discussed. By hiding the figures in this way, the group can avoid the cognitive bias of anchoring, where the first number spoken aloud sets a precedent for subsequent estimates.

In this version, the available sizes are ½, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100, "no idea" and "I need a break".
